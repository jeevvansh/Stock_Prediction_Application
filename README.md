##Currently not working until Anaconda pushes an update to support the latest version of Tensorflow, by default Keras only works with the latest version :(

# Stock_Prediction_Application
Welcome! 
This program predicts the closing stock prices of a certain stock specified by the user. It retrieves financial data from yahoo.com and uses the scikit-learn library to make predictions. 80% of the data will be used for training data and the remaining 20% will be predicted. After running, the program produces a graph comparing its predictions and the actual closing prices, and even makes a prediction for tomorrow's closing price. Obviously this program cannot be used to actually predict stock prices, its purpose is just to demonstrate usage of the pandas, keras, and scikit-learn libraries
