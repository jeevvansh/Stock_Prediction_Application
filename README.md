# Stock_Prediction_Application
Welcome! 
This program will predict the closing stock prices of a certain stock specified by the user. 
It will retrieve the latest financial data from yahoo.com and use the scikit-learn machine learning library to make the predictions.
80% of the data will be used for training data and the remaining 20% will be predicted.
After running, the program will produce a graph comparing its predictions and the actual closing prices of the stock. 
In addtion, it will even make a prediction for tommorow's closing price!
Obviously this program cannot be used to actually predict stock prices, the purpose of this project is just to demonstarte usage of the pandas, keras, and scikit-learn libraries
